    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>I am an indoor person who likes to spend his time reading. I like reading about geopolitical issues, news and analysis. I also enjoy reading about new technologies and domestic politics. I am particularly fond of science fiction. I can read for hours on end if a book catches my fancy. <br> Another hobby of mine is music. I like listening to music and playing my guitars. Currently I have 2 acoustic guitars and an electric guitar too. I enjoy spending time plucking the strings on idyllic afternoons. Nowadays, I am more into fingerstyle. Currently, I am learning the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBumgq5yVrA" target="_blank">Let Her Go by Passenger</a>. <br> Another hobby of mine is Japanese anime. I am, by all means, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku" target="_blank">otaku</a>. I have more or less watched all of the essentials and a whole lot more. Even in anime, I prefer science-fiction followed closely by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dnen_manga#:~:text=The%20Japanese%20word%20sh%C5%8Dnen%20(%E5%B0%91%E5%B9%B4,at%20children%20and%20young%20people." target="_blank">shonen</a>. As an otaku, I can also claim to be an avid gamer. I currently boast of having multiple PlayStation consoles. I like single player story-driven games in contrast to the popular trend of playing massive multiplayer games. <br> <br> Despite being an indoor person, I dream of traveling the world. The only reason I want to be a developer is so that I can earn more and get a work from home job so that I can travel to my heart's content. I want to see this world before I can't.  I, currently, live with my two cats, Honey and Caramel.

    <p>My life had been pretty dark before they came along. Now I am happy to have them with me on this joruney, shedding light(literally!) through this cold, dark, wasteland of eternity.</p>
